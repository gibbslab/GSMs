# GSMs
Official Repository for Genome Scale Models created by our group.

## DOPA
These models are GEM reconstrunctions of Dopaminergic Nerve Cells under Parkinson disease
and "healthy" scenarios. During these reconstructions we considered  Caffeine as a neuroprotector.

2021 Version (Not official release). This version comes with an improved OF obtained from field assays. To be published.
Please do not use this version as part of a formal research or as a template for new reconstructions without permission.


## Astrocyte
GEM of human Astrocyte cells. 
Martin-Jimenez model <b>was not created by our group</b>, it was created by our partners at Pntificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√°, Colombia.
We keep this model here because it's been used as template for the creation of an updated version.
