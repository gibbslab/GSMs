## Dopaminergic Nerve cell
These models are GEM reconstrunctions of Dopaminergic Nerve Cells under Parkinson disease
and "healthy" scenarios. During these reconstructions we considered  Caffeine as a neuroprotector.

Not official publication yet for these models, here is a link to the master thesis from where these models come from:

## Potato Leaf
GEM of potato leaf. XLS, sybil and Matlab versions availables.

<b>BoteroPstM1</b> Potato Leaf, Genome Scale Metabolic Model as published on 2019 by our group. This reconstruction has been the base for further versions as shown below.

<b>GuevaraPstM1.1.</b> Update of Botero's model that includes a new OF based on biological data obtained from literature and integrated using BOFDat.
This version is still under revision, has not yet been published and should not be used in your research yet.

<b>Wagner</b> (Not official release). This version comes with an improved OF obtained from field assays, based on Guevara's version. To be published.
Please do not use this version as part of a formal research or as a template for new reconstructions without permission.

Martin-Jimenez model <b>was not created by our group</b>, it was created by our partners at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (PUJ) in Bogot√°, Colombia. We keep this model here because it's been used as template for the creation of further versions (Osorio's and upcoming Mendoza's multiomics version) which we have developed in partnership with PUJ.
